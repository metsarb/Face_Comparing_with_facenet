# Face Detection with FaceNet and Distance Visualization

This repository contains a Python implementation for face detection using `facenet_pytorch` and a script to visualize the distances between positive and negative face pairs.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the following libraries installed:

- `ssl`
- `certifi`
- `torch`
- `facenet_pytorch`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install certifi torch facenet_pytorch opencv-python matplotlib
